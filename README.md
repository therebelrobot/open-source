## What is it?

Open source is a development model that encourages universal access and redistribution of the project’s source *(like code, blueprints, recipes, things like that)*, allowing for third-party modification and redistribution.

Open source celebrates open exchange of information, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community development. It enables self-enhancing diversity of a project’s production.

## Not just software

While most commonly referred to in relation to software, open source as an idea can be used in any industry.

* Media Content *(Wikimedia Foundation)*
* Hardware *(OpenMoko mobile phones, Lasersaur laser cutter)*
* Beverages *(Open Source Cola, Brewtopia)*
* Firearms *(Defense Distributed 3D printed firearms)*
* Medicine *(Tropical Disease Initiative and the Open Source Drug Discovery for Malaria Consortium)*
* Religion *(Open Siddur Project, Open Source Yoga Unity)*
* Education *(Kahn Academy, Wikiversity)*

## The Roots of Open Source

* [Existed long before computing (automobile patents, early 1900s)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source#The_sharing_of_technological_information_before_the_internet)
  * Henry Ford challenged the current patent for the two-cycle gas engine, won, and made the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, which instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all US auto manufacturers: any patents were shared openly and without the need for purchase or threat of lawsuit.
* [SHARE user group (IBM, 1950s)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHARE_(computing))
  * volunteer-run user group for IBM mainframe computers that was a forum for exchanging technical information about programming languages, operating systems, database systems, and user experiences for enterprise users of IBM computers 
* [Request for Comments (RFC) (Internet telecommunications protocols, 1960s)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)
  * describes methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or simply to convey new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor. 
* Officially named “open source” (or OSS) when split from the “free software” movement (Netscape, 1998) 
  * Developers wanted to separate from the political agenda and moral philosophy of the "free software" movement, and emphasize a commercially-minded mindset.
  * Made a split between freeware and OSS, also known as Free as in beer (freeware) vs. Free as in speech (OSS)

## What it looks like today

* Web and Mobile Application development have in most part hugely embraced open source
* It sparked the need for effecient Source Control options (Git, SVN, etc)
* With those options, Social Platforms for Source Controlled software emerged (Github, Google Code) & Forking became a regular practice.
* In larger projects, the Open Governance Model was adopted, to make meetings and decisions on project more transparent
* With more developers assisting worldwide and around the clock, Rapid releases became a common occurance, & with it strict versioning
* Modularization became an important fruit of the OSS movement, it allows for more people to work on the same project in separate parts without stepping on each others toes.

## Examples of Open Source Projects

* Linux
* Android
* Node / io.js
* Angular.js
* Apache
* Eclipse IDE
* Atom text editor

## How to get involved

* Learn and regularly use [IRC chat](http://www.ircbeginner.com/). Most large OSS projects use IRC as its main method of communication
* Open and maintain an active Github account. It gives you an online presence, and employers frequently refer to it as an axample of your skills as a developer.
* Commit publicly whatever code you can, even if you think your code is "crappy" or if there is something else like it already available
* When you find an interesting piece of software, ask about and review the source code
* If you find a bug, patch it and submit it. People are sometimes afraid to make this important leap in development, but it is one of the only real ways to get involved as a contributor
* If you are looking for projects, [up-for-grabs.net](http://up-for-grabs.net) collects and sorts Github issues that have been marked as "up for grabs" or "help needed"
